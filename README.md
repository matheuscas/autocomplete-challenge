# Autocomplete Test of Concept

## Technologies
- Jquery
- Python + Sanic
- Mongodb

## Observations
- Jquery

It could be Vue, Angular or any other front-end framework, but I thought that it would be too much work for a simple thing.

- Python + Sanic

Instead of Python and Sanic, any other simple backend framework would solve it as well. Python is my preferable 
programming language and Sanic is what I'm currently using (note: for further concerns about performance, Sanic would be better cuz its asynchronous processing requests), so that's basically why I chose them.

- Mongodb

This was an intended choice due to performance in search and  ease of use. 

## Build and Run 

`$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

;)
